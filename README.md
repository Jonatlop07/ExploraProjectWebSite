This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About

Explora Projects Website was built to allow the students of Explora UN Mundo course uploading the sypnosis, reviews and abstracts based on topics and specifically documents they chose to work on.

The URL to access the website is [https://fir-react-auth-explora.web.app/].

## Sections

If the user is authenticated (signed up/logged in), he will be able to navigate through:

# Explore

This section shows all the user posts ordered alphabetically by topic. It is possible to scroll up and down the subsection of each topic and see the basic information of each post. The user can see the content of each topic and hide it again to see more articles.

There is a user tab for selecting a profile and see its posts. It will display an entire section with all the posts of that user.

# Home

In this section the user can: Create new posts, see his current posts (and also display the content of each one), edit existing posts and delete them.

# Account

Actually, this section allows the user to change his password.

Now, if the user is not authenticated, then he is only allowed to go to the Explore section, do the same actions as the authenticated user, and go to another section.

# Sign In

In this section the user can log in if he has an account. If not, he can access to a Sign Up form and create an account.

# Thank you for your attention and enjoy this website!
